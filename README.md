## Metacrafters Project of Smart Contract Management
This repository contains the source code for the  `Module_3_My_First_token` smart contract. The contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.18.

## Description
I created a `Module_3_My_First_token` which performs function like IssueToken(used to add token to current address), DestroyToken(used to delete the token from current address), executeTransfer(used to transfer token). in this contract I have created a Token using smart contract and ERC 20.
